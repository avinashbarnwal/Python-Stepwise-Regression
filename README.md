# Python-Stepwise-Regression

Currently Statmodels package in python doesn't have stepwise regression, so i thought why not we create it. I have implemented using AIC and BIC and it has been motivated from http://trevor-smith.github.io/stepwise-post/.

Idea is to build like R-Stepwise having null and full models formula.
